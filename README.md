A quick "What does what" book

<H1>Notes
  There are three documents. You only need to download the PDF file. The various file formats are:
  <h2>PDF
    This is the normal PDF type of file. Download and enjoy.
  <h2>PPP
    This is the Serif PagePlus file. It is the file I use to edit the document but you can download and modify it if you want.
  <h2>ZIP
    This is the Microsoft WORD (2003) file. It is so large I had to zip it in order to be able to upload it. You can download it and modify it also - but - this is a huge file. Something like over 100MB in size whereas the PDF and PPP file are only around 2MB in size. Unknown why.
  <h2>Images
    These are all of the images used in the PDF, PPP, and ZIP files.
